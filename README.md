## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java, being an object-oriented language, emphasizes the principles of OOP, which include:
- **Classes and Objects:** Blueprint from which individual objects are created.
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- **Encapsulation:** Wrapping the data (variables) and the code (methods) together as a single unit.

## Data Types

Java offers various data types, both primitive (like int, float, char) and non-primitive (like String). These determine the type and size of data associated with variables.

## Control Structures

Control structures dictate the flow of execution in a program. This includes:
- **Conditional Statements:** such as `if-else` and `switch`.
- **Looping Structures:** like `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## Methods and Functions

Methods in Java are blocks of code that perform a specific task and are executed when called. They can be user-defined or built-in.

## Setup and Usage

To run any of the Java programs:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired directory or file.
3. Compile the Java program:
   ```
   javac file_name.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java ClassName
   ```
